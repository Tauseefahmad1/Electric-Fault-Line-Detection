# Electric-Fault-Line-Detection
A collection of line currents and voltages for different fault conditions
The electrical power system consists of so many different complex dynamic and interacting elements, which are always prone to disturbance or an electrical fault. The use of high capacity electrical generating power plants and concept of grid, i.e. synchronized electrical power plants and geographical displaced grids, required fault detection and operation of protection equipment in minimum possible time so that the power system can remain in stable condition. The faults on electrical power system transmission lines are supposed to be first detected and then be classified correctly and should be cleared as fast as possible. The protection system used for a transmission line can also be used to initiate the other relays to protect the power system from outages. A good fault detection system provides an effective, reliable, fast and secure way of a relaying operation.

 

An agency of the Government Power Corporation seeks your help to solve this challenge. Your Task is to build a Machine Learning algorithm to classify the type of Fault in the electric power lines to prevent any mishap.
